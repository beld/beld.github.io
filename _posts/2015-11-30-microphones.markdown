    Currently, I have implemented an iOS app for speech recognition, which is one part of our project for visually impaired skiers to learn skiing.
I was given a budget up to 300 EUR to buy a microphone for testing the accuracy of speech recognition. The microphone should be lightweight and has the excellent ability of noise and wind canceling.

First of all, there is a speech recognition accuracy rating of microphones by Nuance, [Link](http://support.nuance.com/compatibility/Search.asp?PRO=DNS&CID=15), but it was not considering the noise & wind. Besides, some microphones are too expensive and this rating is a little bit out of date. Since I actually have no knowledge of microphones before, the most intuitive way is to watch the test videos. I chose two from the list with noise cancellation and wind suppression, namely *VXi VoxStar™ UC* and *Plantronics Voyager Legend Pro*, and another one, *SpeechWare FlexyMike Dual Ear Cardioid*.

#### VXi VoxStar™ UC

VXi VoxStar™ UC headset claims to eliminate up to 93% of background noise. It has three ways to wear it, Over-the-head, Over-the-ear, and Behind-the-Neck. There is a test video with iPad on a noisy street: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIBGVod3gBs). The Product page is [Link](http://www.vxicorp.com/solutions/speech-recognition/voxstar-uc/). Its price is EUR 103.

It claims having the best noise & wind canceling. The Product page is [link](http://www.plantronics.com/uk/product/voyager-legend#fndtn-overview). Its price is EUR 113.

#### SpeechWare FlexyMike Dual Ear Cardioid
This one was highly recommended by [SpeechRecSolutions](SpeechRecSolutions.com) and claimed to have the highest accuracy. The technical details about it: [Product Review: SpeechWare FlexyMike Dual Ear Cardioid](http://www.speechrecsolutions.com/assets/productreviews/SpeechWare_FMKDEC_review.pdf).
There is an very impressive test video: [SpeechWare FlexyMike & USB Adapter at Niagara Falls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad5DUK8nkdk). I highly recommend you to watch it. And its price is $196.00 and only available in US amazon.
